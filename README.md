# Kalman Filter Workshop
This is a 1-hour workshop that consists of two exercises:
1) Linear Kalman Filters
2) Extended Kalman Filters

Required toolboxes: 
* MATLAB
* Simulink
* Aerospace Toolbox & Blockset
* Control System Toolbox
* Navigation Toolbox
* Optimization Toolbox
* Simscape & Simscape Multibody

## Setup Instructions:
1. Launch your browser. We recommend using Google Chrome.
2. Access a temporary license for MATLAB Online here: [https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/4381550/](https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/4381550/). If you do not already have a MathWorks.com account, you will need to make one.
3. Once in MATLAB Online (you should see "matlab.mathworks.com" in your browser's address bar), replace the address with this new address and press enter: [https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=juliabrault-ML/KalmanFilterWorkshop&project=Kalmanfilterworkshop.prj](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=juliabrault-ML/KalmanFilterWorkshop&project=Kalmanfilterworkshop.prj). If you get a pop-up asking if it's okay to leave the site, click "Leave".
4. MATLAB will open a window confirming it's okay to clone the files from the repository. Click the checkbox next to "I understand...", then click "Save and Open". The workshop files will be automatically loaded into your MATLAB Drive, and the Exercise #1 live script will open.
